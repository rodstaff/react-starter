Ref:  Youtube="Getting started with React development", by Radu Brehar
Ref:  Youtube="React Tutorial (with Webpack + ES6)", by Michael Cheng

Each tutorial needed some tweaking especially in the development environment set up in order for it to work and by combining both created a ToDo App.  This app uses Webpack to generate a bundled JavaScript file that the browser can read.

To run on terminal in the app directory:  '$ npm run dev'
