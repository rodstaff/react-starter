This app uses Webpack to generate a bundled JavaScript file that the browser can read.

(Note: There is a small error in the youtube tutorial that, if not corrected, will prevent the app from working.  Look at the 'dev.config.js' file carefully.)

To run on terminal in the app directory:  '$ npm run dev'
